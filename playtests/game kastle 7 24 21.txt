- Carriers are hard to identify. New type? or icon or something
- When do abilities on cards get played? Same as actions or different?
- Do squadrons die when their carrier or territory dies/captured? Put in rules
- For cutting cards: Rotatrim Mastercut 2
- Term for not hidden. Face up?
- Is allow a full reshuffle during deployment between hand and play too much work?
- MAKE A REFERENCE CARD FOR RULES AND ESPECIALLY PHASES OF A TURN
- layout cards so that stats show when stacking planes
- Make font of important stats larger. Make UX better for associating it with territories
- Cards with 2 help defense rules should have a single rule like "2 + 1 for each plane" or should just have 2 adjacent rules
- Rapid Mobilization / search your deck card is a bad card for a starter deck where the player doesn't know what they have...
- Make a starter deck and mauybe a list of strategies for modifying that deck
- Starter deck could be fewer than 40 cards to make things easier and gameplay shorter
- Use tokens to indicate damage to help math during combat?
- If you lose your territories or some other snowballed status should you just lose?
- Be more clear about when you have to flip face up
- Currently no reason to attack unlesss you have superiority, so maybe we need imperfect info like hidden cards don't flip up.
- Siege is not punishing enough - no incentive to want cards with siege.
- How many turns is this game expected to be?
- Siege could just be a blanket 1 per card with additional siege being a special ability - removes siege as a stat.
- Deck construction game. Not deck building game.
- Make different types of cards look more different. Easier to distinguish between say squadrons and ships
- Territories provide different advantages or logistics for different card types...
- Should players choose a starting hand?
- Do we really need attack and defense as seperate stats? Could simplify combat...
- Put different stats in different places on the card - combat stats shouldn't be mixed in with logistics
