Version 1.0
•	Kuznetsov shouldn’t be super carrier
•	5 card hand
•	Just play all your ships on first turn?? Seems strange- makes early game a bloodbath.
•	Should ships be able to attack flipped over? Maybe only stealth and subs?
•	Oscar needs strategic missiles
•	Should stealth and subs be able to hide at end of turn after attack?
•	Too many ships on board – too much math – etc.
•	How does multiple blockers work?
•	Ships should maybe be able to attack ships
•	Blockers based on who is next to who?
•	Attacking subs and surface ships?
•	Mana?
•	Harrier more expensive
•	Planes become squadrons

Version 1.1
•	5 cards or 7 cards?
•	Maybe restrict face down assets to number of territories
•	Logistics capacity values feel high, defense also feels high
•	Udaloy > arleigh burke
•	Air wing face down? How to garrison?
•	AF is short on water reword
•	Face down ships causes stalemate really easily – needs a counter-tactic or weakness
•	ASW helicopters make submarines not good – need to be better against asw or way better against not asw
•	Consider making helicopter score a modifier and not a number of submarines
•	Make seawolf ability better by letting controller choose
•	Maybe always allow discarding to draw a card?
•	Attacking territories isn’t very good. Maybe also does damage to player
•	Ship shore attacks are really low
•	Air Wings are way worse than ships
•	Make helicopters a bonus instead of a penalty
•	Seawolf is way worse than Ticonderoga
•	Really should get images and backgrounds
•	Stealth Fighter vs Long range SAM: who takes precedence? Probably stealth
•	Flipped carrier is obvious: let players play flipped cards like carriers
•	Kirov has strategic strike – incorrect
•	Nimitz is way too good?
•	Ohio vs Oscar cost
•	Cant see plane stats on car when stacking on carrier
•	F-35B 3 att vs su27 5 seems wrong
•	Need to add some balance math to the spreadsheet (attack/logistics, defense/logistics, combined/log, etc)
•	Hard to tell and remember how many cards your opponent has and culd miscount
•	Very hard to come back from snowball if opponent has a ton of ships and territories
•	 Maybe reconquer on land rule – discard x cards to return a piece of territory to your control


version 1.4
• Add rule about when captured territory logistics count. Can you flip additional subs?
