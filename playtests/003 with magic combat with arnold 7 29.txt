-Do planes still stack on carriers? Do they unstack when they attack?
-Why would I ever block a sub which has low siege?
-How does help defense work on the defensive? Is it ships that haven't blocked?
-Really good cards hard to deal with - can't attack because no multi-attack and good
cards could even come out turn 1. How does this get dealt with?
- Help attack as well as defense?
- Sacrifice planes to kill stuff or do damage equal to attack?
- Unblocked planes do help attack? Could be good for handling big stuff
- Maybe subs can't block planes and vise versa?
- Can all cards go in back/front line or just some kinds?
- What order does help defense get declared in? Attacker first?
- burn cards must be rebalanced for 30 cards
- hidden cards maybe can't be escorts?
- subs cant be escorts?
- "may draw" vs must draw results in stalemates and slow end-games
- carriers help defense needs to be about stationed planes and not all planes. otherwise it's insane
- can an aircraft carrier block? it can block other carrier to nerf help defense, which feels weird.
maybe just give it a "cannot block" ability.
- how does aerial refueling affect blocking? is this card better or worse than having a carrier in its place?
- is early siege damage too punishing? Can players recover from siege damage early? Make up card deficit.
- does it really matter what territory a plane is on? maybe modify this rule
- how do I do placement when attacking? front line, back line, subs which are neither, non attackers. how do
I organize all these various cards?
- What are subs even for?
