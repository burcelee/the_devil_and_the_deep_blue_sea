Cards about ships

Software:
- LibreOffice Calc and Writer are used for the open format files.
- A VBA macro is used in the cards spreadsheet to export all cards to csv
- CardMaker is used to create printable card pages from csv. The ".cmp" file is the project file for CardMaker.
  It is available here: https://www.nhmk.com/cardmaker.php

Some rules:
- All data/content files are plaintext
- Version numbers follow [*major revision*.*minor revision*.*patch*] 
  This is the second versioning scheme. 
  The first used only major and minor revision. 
  Therefore all 3 term versions come after all 2 term versions.
