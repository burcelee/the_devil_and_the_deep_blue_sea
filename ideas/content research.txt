Need to figure out time-frame. It might be more interesting to set this in say 2025-2030 after a quick period of naval rearmament.

USN can be balanced by giving it insufficient logistics support / only non-US territories. This will cause the US to become a control deck that must defend itself in the early game to snowball in the late.

Russian ships and strategy:
The Russian navy is large enough and advanced enough to take on any other, except the USN. Its carrier is second only to Charles de Gaulle and Nimitz/ford, and it has powerful surface combatants in the slava and kirov class cruisers. In a fight against an inferior force, it could also rely upon a large range of capable attack submarines.
Against the USN, the Russian navy must try to fight bloody and quick before the USN can bring up their expensive forces. This can be further helped by subterfuge and cyberwarfare to disrupt USN logistics and strategy.
Russian amphibious forces are not particularly advanced

Oscar II are “carrier destroyers”. High attack, high shore attack low defense glass cannons.
Akula class are the work-horses. Equal to Los Angeles
Sierra II are the fancy titanium ones. High defense submarines.
Yasen/Graney are cheaper and close to but slightly inferior to virginia class
Mig-29k are very cheap and therefore good for cheap fleet defense. Log 1 probably. Not a particularly heavy strike fighter, so probably largely useless against shore and limited against ships.
