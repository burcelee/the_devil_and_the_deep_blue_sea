	Draw Power / stacking:
		Scuttlebutt - Card is pretty well balanced. Might need to add a "draw a card" to it so it doesn't create card disadvantage.
		
		Military industrial complex - solid strategy. no stacking.
		
		nato allies - solid card. also a combat trick.
		
		I have not yet begun to fight - solid card, but top decking makes it situationally useful. Might need to be directly into hand to avoid card disadvantage.
	
	Combat Tricks
		AF is Short On Water - Good but limited. Perhaps could change to putting any number of cards from hand into play.
		
		Uncommon valor was a common virtue - Kinda don't like this card's effect. It's a little too technical and hard to understand. Does the card still affect defense? What if it's a surprise attacker? Could instead have this be either a strategy
		or a one-time effect of the idea I had for semper fidelis

		
		That's the spirit - Fine as is

		KH-11 Key Hole

		semper fidelis - Could switch to an ability for an attacker to discard cards equal to a territories logistics to auto-cap it after the defender discards to save it. Might get rid of this card and use its effect for uncommon valor. Or could keep with current effect.
			This might actually be a pretty bad effect. Discarding 6
			cards is pretty significant - and territories can often
			just be immediately replaced. Perhaps if its a strategy
			it could be part of a aggro strategy, but its hard to 
			imagine this being a useful one-off.

	carrier
		Aerial refueling - Maybe change to letting planes stationed on territories attack. This could be useful for mitigating the compatibility issues of the USN air force. Maybe this card counts as a carrier 2 or carrier 3? Stack?
