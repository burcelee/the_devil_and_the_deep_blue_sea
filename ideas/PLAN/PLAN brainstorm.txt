Submarines:
Jin/Tang/Xia class - nuclear ballistic missile subs.
Sui class (Type 095) - Modern brand new Nuclear attack sub
Shang class (Type 093) - LA/Akula class equivalent perhaps. has VLS
Han class - old nuke attack sub
Yuan class - Extreme quiet modern diesel sub
Song class - disel sub
Kilo class - import
Ming class - out-teched disel 

Aircraft carriers:
Liaoning (kuznetsov class) - Has had missiles removed for more planes.
Shandong - domestic version of kuznetsov
Type 003 - Not yet complete supercarriers
Type 075 - attack helicopter carrier


Aircraft:
J-15 Flying Shark - Based on Su-33. 4th generation. Slightly Superior / on part with superhornet, perhaps less siege. Worse sensors
Assault ships:


Destroyers
Type 55 Renhai - Stealth destroyer/cruiser. air defense / large VLS
Type 52D Luyang III - Smaller VLS, multi-role.
Type 52C Luyang II - Surface to air only escort destroyer. Small VLS
Type 51C Luzhou class - surface to air even shittier than 52c
Sovremenny
a few other destroyers...

Frigates
Type 054A (Jiangkai II) - primarily AA frigate. By far most numerous.
Jiangkai, Jiangwei and Jianghu class - Generally shitsy, mostly guns. Not many left in service.

Corvettes:
Type 056 Jiangdao - Small but relatively well armed for coastal defense.


Action Card ideas:

Great firewall - something about not having to discard, or maybe stealth
centrally planned economy - something about returning discarded cards to library. maybe a 	turtle-oriented strategy
strategic destabilization - like russians


overall strategy of deck:
- Lots of small outteched surface ships. Want to fight a coastal fight where they can use their corvettes and frigates and diesel subs effectively.
- Very high tech modern cruiser/destroyers
- 2 medium capable aircraft carriers - cheaper than other carriers likely.
- probably wants to turtle and let other player trade unfavorably before going on attack. 
- perhaps uses a lot of combat tricks
- Territories are well defended and hard to capture.
- Help defense generally less effective than AEGIS but ships are still very modern
- 52D is the workhorse. 55 is the flagship type ship
